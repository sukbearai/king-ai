description: "Reproduce, migrate, or audit a Grok CLI stack on a new Mac: install CLIProxyAPI with Homebrew, route Grok CLI through the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint, deploy a private Cloudflare temporary-email Worker, configure grok-register for Cloudflare mail and CPA OIDC export, perform an explicitly authorized registration batch, recover rate-limited CPA exports, and verify the runtime without committing credentials. Use for new-machine setup, disaster recovery, Grok/CPA configuration drift, Cloudflare temp-mail migration, or batch-registration handoff."

# Grok CPA Bootstrap

Rebuild the verified local chain:

```text
Grok CLI -> CPA on 127.0.0.1:8317 -> xAI OIDC auth files
                                      ^
grok-register -> Cloudflare temp mail -+
```

Treat installation, Cloudflare deployment, account creation, and model entitlement as separate checkpoints. A populated model catalog does not prove that a model can answer requests.

## Source Repositories

Use these canonical remotes when rebuilding the stack:

- King AI shared skill and agent runtime: `https://github.com/sukbearai/king-ai.git`
- Grok registration automation: `https://github.com/AaronL725/grok-register.git`
- Cloudflare temporary-mail Worker: `https://github.com/dreamhunter2333/cloudflare_temp_email.git`
- CLIProxyAPI (CPA) upstream source: `https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI.git`

Install CPA through Homebrew as described below. Clone its upstream repository only when source inspection or source-based recovery is required. Before reusing an existing checkout, verify `git remote get-url origin`; record or pin commit IDs when exact reproducibility matters.

## Activate on a New Machine

Clone King AI, then expose this skill directly to Codex:

```bash
KING_AI_REPO="${KING_AI_REPO:-$HOME/workspace/github/pnpm/king-ai}"
git clone https://github.com/sukbearai/king-ai.git "$KING_AI_REPO"
install -d "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
ln -s "$KING_AI_REPO/packages/skills/skills/grok-cpa-bootstrap" \
  "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/grok-cpa-bootstrap"
```

For every King AI agent, point `KING_AI_SHARED_SKILLS` at the directory that directly contains all shared skill folders, then restart the daemon:

```bash
export KING_AI_SHARED_SKILLS="$KING_AI_REPO/packages/skills/skills"
```

Do not point `KING_AI_SHARED_SKILLS` at the individual `grok-cpa-bootstrap` directory. The runtime discovers child directories containing `SKILL.md`.

## Operating Contract

- Target macOS with Homebrew unless the user explicitly asks for another platform.
- Inspect existing installations and configuration before mutating them. Preserve unrelated services, DNS records, shell configuration, and repositories.
- Never commit or print API keys, Cloudflare tokens, JWT secrets, mailbox credentials, passwords, SSO cookies, OAuth tokens, account result files, or complete auth JSON.
- Generate fresh secrets on each machine. Do not copy secrets from examples, previous sessions, logs, or this skill.
- Store sensitive local files with mode `600` and secret directories with mode `700`.
- Keep `~/.cli-proxy-api/config.yaml`, `~/.grok/config.toml`, and the managed shell environment block consistent.
- Require explicit user authorization and an exact count before creating real external accounts. Do not infer permission to register accounts from a request to install or audit the stack.
- Pause for the user if a CAPTCHA or manual identity check appears. Do not claim success from browser progress alone.
- Keep the Cloudflare root-domain mail route unchanged. Bind only the selected mail subdomain catch-all to the temporary-email Worker.
- Treat `personal-team-blocked:spending-limit` as upstream entitlement failure, not CPA import failure.
- Do not publish, deploy unrelated Workers, purchase credits, or subscribe accounts without explicit authorization.

## Required Inputs

Obtain or discover:

- Workspace root for the Python and TypeScript checkouts.
- Cloudflare-managed root domain.
- Mail subdomain, for example `mail.example.com`.
- Worker API hostname, for example `temp-mail-api.example.com`.
- Registration count. Default to a single dry-run mailbox unless real registration is explicitly authorized.
- Grok default model. Prefer a model proven by a live CPA call; `grok-4.5` was the verified default in the source session but availability can change.
- Proxy requirements for browser and OIDC flows.

Generate locally:

- CPA downstream API key.
- Temporary-mail `JWT_SECRET`.
- Temporary-mail administrator password.

## 1. Inspect the Machine

Run a read-only preflight:

```bash
sw_vers
uname -m
command -v brew git python3 node pnpm grok jq curl
brew services list | grep '^cliproxyapi' || true
grok --version || true
grok inspect || true
test -f ~/.cli-proxy-api/config.yaml && stat -f '%Sp %N' ~/.cli-proxy-api/config.yaml
test -f ~/.grok/config.toml && stat -f '%Sp %N' ~/.grok/config.toml
```

Check for existing `grok-register` and `cloudflare_temp_email` repositories. Do not overwrite dirty checkouts. Use `git status --short` before touching either repository.

## 2. Install CPA and Source Repositories

Install CPA:

```bash
brew install cliproxyapi
brew services stop cliproxyapi
install -d -m 700 ~/.cli-proxy-api
```

Create `~/.cli-proxy-api/config.yaml` from the installed sample or a minimal configuration. Bind to localhost, set `auth-dir` to the same private directory, and place a newly generated downstream key under `api-keys`. Back up an existing config before changing it.

```yaml
host: "127.0.0.1"
port: 8317
auth-dir: "~/.cli-proxy-api"
api-keys:
  - "GENERATE_A_FRESH_VALUE"
```

Keep the Homebrew service config linked to the private file:

```bash
mv "$(brew --prefix)/etc/cliproxyapi.conf" \
  "$(brew --prefix)/etc/cliproxyapi.conf.bak"  # only when no backup exists
ln -s ~/.cli-proxy-api/config.yaml "$(brew --prefix)/etc/cliproxyapi.conf"
chmod 600 ~/.cli-proxy-api/config.yaml
brew services start cliproxyapi
```

Clone the source repositories into explicit language directories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaronL725/grok-register.git <workspace>/github/python/grok-register
git clone https://github.com/dreamhunter2333/cloudflare_temp_email.git \
  <workspace>/github/typescript/cloudflare_temp_email
```

Read each checkout's `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, README, and ignored-config examples before continuing. Repository schemas and CLI flags may drift.

## 3. Route Grok CLI Through CPA

Use the bundled configurator. Supply the key through an environment variable, never a command-line argument:

```bash
read -s 'CPA_API_KEY?CPA API key: '
export CPA_API_KEY
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/configure_grok_cpa.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1 \
  --default-model grok-4.5
unset CPA_API_KEY
```

The script updates only managed values in `~/.grok/config.toml` and a marked block in `~/.zshenv`, preserves surrounding content, and sets both files to mode `600`. Start a new login shell or restart any existing King AI daemon so it inherits `XAI_API_KEY`.

Verify without making a model call:

```bash
zsh -lc 'grok models'
```

The output must say `You are using XAI_API_KEY`, list CPA models, and mark the requested default. Existing King AI agents with an explicit `model` setting still override the Grok CLI default.

## 4. Deploy Private Cloudflare Temp Mail

Read [references/cloudflare-temp-mail.md](references/cloudflare-temp-mail.md) before changing Cloudflare. Follow its D1, Worker, custom-domain, Email Routing subdomain, and catch-all verification sequence.

Stop after API and routing verification unless the user has also authorized account creation.

## 5. Configure and Run grok-register

Read [references/registration-cpa.md](references/registration-cpa.md) before creating `config.json` or starting a browser. Keep the config ignored and mode `600`.

Create the Python environment and run the repository tests before a live batch:

```bash
cd <workspace>/github/python/grok-register
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

After explicit authorization of the exact count, run the CLI unbuffered and monitor it through completion:

```bash
printf 'start\n' | PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 .venv/bin/python grok_register_ttk.py cli
```

Do not expose generated passwords, mailbox JWTs, SSO tokens, or verification codes in the final report. Set result files to mode `600` after the process exits.

## 6. Recover CPA OIDC Rate Limits

Registration success and CPA export success are separate. Preserve registered accounts when OIDC export reports `429 slow_down`.

Run the bundled sequential recovery tool against the saved account file:

```bash
<grok-register>/.venv/bin/python <skill-dir>/scripts/retry_cpa_auth.py \
  --repo <grok-register> \
  --accounts <grok-register>/accounts_<timestamp>.txt \
  --expected-count <count>
```

The tool skips existing auth files, waits between accounts, retries transient failures, and closes its reusable browser on exit. Never reduce the cooldown merely to make the run finish sooner.

## 7. Verify End to End

Run the safe audit first:

```bash
zsh -lc 'python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/audit_stack.py --expected-auth-count <count>'
```

Only when the user wants a billable or quota-consuming inference check, add `--live`:

```bash
zsh -lc 'python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/audit_stack.py \
  --expected-auth-count <count> --model grok-4.5 --live'
```

Acceptance requires:

- `cliproxyapi` is running on localhost.
- Authenticated `/v1/models` succeeds.
- Every expected `xai-*.json` is mode `600` and structurally valid.
- `grok models` uses the CPA endpoint and shows the selected default.
- A live Grok CLI request returns an end-turn response when live verification is authorized.
- Cloudflare D1 address and mail counts match the completed batch.
- Both source repositories remain free of unintended tracked changes.

If one model returns a credit error, test only a model the user explicitly wants to verify. Do not conclude that every model is unavailable from a different model's entitlement response.

## Handoff

Report:

- Installed CPA and Grok CLI versions.
- Local CPA URL and selected default model, without the API key.
- Worker name, API hostname, D1 database name, and mail domain, without Cloudflare secrets.
- Requested, registered, and CPA-auth counts.
- Test and audit commands run.
- Any upstream entitlement error by exact model.
- Sensitive file locations and permissions.
- Whether existing daemons must be restarted.

Do not include generated account lines, auth JSON bodies, verification codes, or historical secrets.
